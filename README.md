Self-critique:

During this project I have been able to refresh what I learned from previous classes and also learn new things during the way. I like how we were able to remake the iit.edu page and I believe we did a good job by choosing user friendly and simple design as our main goal. Personally, I feel like I have learned a lot during this class and this project as well, first of all, the importance of always thinking about the user when designing a webpage.
Group critique:

I thik, as a team, we did a good job in this project, it was nice to have a team that was focused on working together and getting this done. Eun did a great job keeping the main repository updated. She also created the iit-header image and other images needed, and we all think they look fantastic. Matthew was a very active member of the group, worked very hard in the registration page and it turned out to be a great design. He was the main organizer and I think he did a great job at it. Katherine took care of the user testing part of the project, she also did a great jod at it, it was very organized.
